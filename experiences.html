            <p>I began my career as an architect and graphic designer because of my passion for visuals.
                Over time, I craved a challenge, so I began to train as a UX Designer. One aspect of my job I
                love is that I can solve problems for a company by researching. I use my skill set to look into
                what the customers want and need and figure out how to make their experience better.
                I am interested in working as a UX designer because I want to help companies create
                products that are easy and enjoyable to use. I can prototype and wireframe to help you
                understand how people might use a product.</p>
